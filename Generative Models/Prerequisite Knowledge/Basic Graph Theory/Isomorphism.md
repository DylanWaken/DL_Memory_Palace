Isomorphism  is a structure-preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. 

In graph theory, the isomorphism between graph $G$ and $H$ means their exists a one-to-one function:
$$f : V(G) \rightarrow V(H)$$
that maps between all vertices of both graphs, the function is invertable. 

In addition, if $u,v \in V(G)$ and $f(u), f(v) \in V(H)$ . The vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent to each others in graph $G$ if and only if $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ are adjacent to each other in graph $H$.

the example of isomorphism is shown below:

Note that all connection relationships (edges) are preserved in the mapping process.
