A undirected graph is said to be symmetric if given any two pairs of adjacent vertices $u_1,v_1$ and $u_2, v_2$ of $\mathcal{G}$, there is an [[automorphism]]:
$$f : V(\mathcal{G}) \rightarrow V(\mathcal{G})$$
such that:
$$f(u_1) = u_2 \quad \text{and} \quad f(v_1) = v_2$$
Symmetric Graphs are also referred to as **Arc-transitive graph**

The vertices have connetion relationships maintained the same before and after the mapping is applied.
