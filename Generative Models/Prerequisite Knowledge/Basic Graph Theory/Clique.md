A clique is a subset of the vertices in the given [[Graph]] that all vertices in the clique is adjacent to each other.  A clique is also considered as a [[Subgraph]] of the given [[Graph]] $\mathcal{G}$ with nodes and edges that is complete.

//the dmeo show some cliques in the [[Graph]]

For a clique to be feasible, the [[Degree]] of all the vertices in the clique must be equal to or greater than the amount of vertices in the clique. that is:
$$d(v_i) \geq |C_{\mathcal{G}}| \text{ for } v_i \in C_{\mathcal{G}}$$
