A maximal [[Clique]] (***NOT maximum [[Clique]]***) is defined as the [[Clique]] that can not be expanded by adding any vertices from the [[Graph]] $\mathcal{G}$

- There can exist multiple maximal cliques in the [[Graph]]
- Maximal [[Clique]] is achieved when any of the nodes have the degree of the [[Clique]] size. However, this is a sufficient but not necessary condition. (maximal [[Clique]] can also be achieved with size less than the degree of any vertices in it)
