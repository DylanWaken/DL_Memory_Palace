Automorphism is the representation of graph symmetry, in which their capability of mapping onto itself while maintaining the vertex-edge connections. 

If we treat a graph as the permutation $\sigma$ among the vertices set $V$, and therefore the pair of vertices $u,v$ can form an edge if and only if the pair ($\sigma(u)$,$\sigma(v)$) also forms an edge. That is also equivalent of the graph [[isomorphism]] of $G$ to itself. 

In the easier explanation, in the given graph $G$, there exists another way of "index" the vertices in the origional graph, and the new graph with new indexes satisfies all connection relationships in the original graph.
