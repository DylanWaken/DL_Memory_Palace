A [[Probability Density]] function (PDF) is the function of a probabilistic distribution of a continuous random variable. The function is the derivative of the Cumulative Density Function (CDF), as :

$$f_X(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx}Fx\left( x\right)$$

Note: The specific value in the [[Probability Density]] funtion can be greater than 1, and since then the PDF value of event $x$ is not ensured to be the probability of event $x$ 

The [[Probability Density]] function must satisfy the following properties:

$f_X(x) \geq 0$

$\int _{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x) dx = 1$

$\int _{x \in A} f_X(x) dx = P(x \in A)$
