Inner Product Space is also called the pre-[[Hilbert Space]].

The inner product space is a [[Normed Vector Space]] that supports the operation of inner product (or dot product) between any of the two elements in the vector space.  

The norm of the pre-[[Hilbert Space]] is defined as:

$$||x|| = \sqrt{<x,x>}$$

- $<x,y>$ stands for the inner product between x and y, same as $x^Ty$

Inner product space boosted the concept of included degrees and length of vectors, which is the same for the concept of or orthognality.
