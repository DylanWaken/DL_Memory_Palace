A Cauchy Sequence  is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses. More precisely, given any small positive distance, all but a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other.

- Every cauchy sequence is converging toward specific values
- Every cauchy sequence is bounded sequence
- Any converging sequence is cauchy sequence

It is not sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the _preceding_ term (for example sequence generated from $y = \sqrt{x}$ is not cauchy since it blows up to infinity)
