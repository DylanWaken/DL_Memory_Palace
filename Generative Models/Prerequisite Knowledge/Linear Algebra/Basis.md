Basis vectors are the vectors in a vector space which are [[Linearly independent]] to others. 

if given a set of basis vectors $B$ for vector space $\mathcal{V}$, and for $\forall \alpha _i \in \mathbb{R}$: 
$$\sum _{i = 1} ^{||B||} \alpha_i\vec{b_i}$$
or linear combinations of basis vectors can be used to find any vectors that are within the vector space defined by the basis.

On the other hand, since basis vectors are [[Linearly independent]], we can not find a new basis vector through adding and scaling the existing basis vectors.

for a vector space $\mathcal{V} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , there are exactly  $n$ basis vectors.

There can be multiple sets of basis vectors existing for the same vector space, and the calculation for new vector coordinates can be done through the "change of basis transformation". documnted here: [Change of basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis)
