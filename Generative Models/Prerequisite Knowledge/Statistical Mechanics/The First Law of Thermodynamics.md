The first law of thermodynamics refers to the conservation of energy adapted for the thermodynamic processes. 

**Extensive thermodynamic variables** are variables thjat scale proportionally to the object or system size. variables such as mass, moles, internel energy, [[entropy]] and heat capacity are extensive thermodynamic variables.(property of system states)

**Intensive thermodynamic variables** are variables that are independent from the object or system size. Such as temperature, pessure, concentration, mass fraction.... (actions performed on external agents).

The first law of thermodynamics is as follows:
$$\Delta U = Q-W$$
- $\Delta U$ is the change in the internal energy of a system.
- $Q$ is the quantity of energy supplied _to_ the system as heat
- $W$ is the amout of thermodynamic work done by the system on surrounding systems.

The first law of thermodynamics is the equivalent to saying:
**Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another.**

If we denot only the changes, we have:
$$dU = dQ + dW$$
Where the change in the total internal energy is equal to the difference of change in heat and work done

If we introduce the definition of [[Entropy]], we can rewrite this function as:
$$dU = TdS - PdV$$
