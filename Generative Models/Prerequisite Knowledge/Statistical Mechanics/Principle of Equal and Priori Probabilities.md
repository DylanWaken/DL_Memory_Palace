An isolated system in thermal equilibrium is equally likely to be in any one of the accessible [[Microstate]]. 

There is a useful conclusion from this principle. If we measure the entropy of the system using [[Gibbs Entropy]], the point where the systme reaches its minimal entropy is the moment when all the probabilities are uniform, as:
$$\min_P S_G = k_B\sum_ip_i\log p_i$$ is achieved when $P_i \sim Uniform(P)$
