Carnot engine is a theoritical model for a heat engine, it uses idea gas as the medium for the heat-work conversion.

In an ideal carnot engine, this cycle process can be shown as:

- Isothermal process is **a thermodynamic process in which the temperature of a system remains constant**. The ideal gas draw heat from tank or give heat back to a tank with no temperature change.

- Adiabatic process is **a thermodynamic process in which there is no heat transfer from in or out of the system**. The ideal gas does not draw heat from the tank or give heat to a tank, but the temperature of the gas changes with its volume.

In this cycle, if we plot the [[Entropy]] - temperature graph, we have:

In this cycling process, the ideal Carnot engine should convert all of its heat difference into work as described in the [[Carnot Theorem]].
