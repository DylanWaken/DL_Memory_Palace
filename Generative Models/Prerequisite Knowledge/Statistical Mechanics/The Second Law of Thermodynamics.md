The second law of thermodynamics says that:

 **heat always moves from hotter objects to colder objects, unless energy is supplied to reverse the direction of heat flow.** 

For idealized reversable models, the equal condition for [[Clausius Inequality]] is achieved, in which the total [[Entropy]] released into the surroundings of the system is equal to zero:
$$\oint \frac{ \delta Q }{T} = 0 $$
However, in any possible cases of thermodynamic systems, a portion of heat will dissipate into the surroundings, meaning that:
$$\oint \frac{ \delta Q }{T} < 0 $$
since we defined entropy as:
$$dS = \frac{\delta Q}{T}$$
Under the non-ideal circumstance, we have:
$$- \oint dS_ =  \oint \frac{ \delta Q }{T}  < 0 $$
- The total output of entropy from the system to the surrounding is greater than zero. 
or in the other words:
$$\Delta S > 0$$
