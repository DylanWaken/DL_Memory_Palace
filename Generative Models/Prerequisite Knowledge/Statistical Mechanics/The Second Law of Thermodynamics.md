The second law of thermodynamics says that:

 **heat always moves from hotter objects to colder objects, unless energy is supplied to reverse the direction of heat flow.** 

And in this process, the entropy of an isolated system would always increase, as:

In the standard thermodynamic definition of [[Entropy]]:
$$S = \frac{Q}{T} \quad dS = \frac{\delta Q}{T}$$
Given two segments of the system with temperatures $T_H$ and $T_C$ . According to [[The Second Law of Thermodynamics]], there must be an exchange of heat between the segments, as:
$$T_H > T_C$$
Assume the same piece of heat $\delta Q$ is flowing from the hotter segment to the cooler segment. The net entropy decreased on the hotter segment is less than the entropy created on the cooler segment, as:
$$dS_H = \frac{\delta Q}{T_H}\quad dS_C = \frac{\delta Q}{T_C}\quad dS_H < dS_C$$
And entropy would always increase in the heat transfer.
