In statistical mechanics, the ensemble average is defined as the mean of a quantity that is a function of the microstate of a system, according to the distribution of the system on its micro-states in this ensemble.

The ensemble average of variable $A$ over all the microstates is given as:
$$\bar A = \sum_j A_jP_j = \frac{\sum_jA_je^{-\beta E_j}}{\sum_je^{-\beta E_j}}$$
- $\beta$ is the thermaldynamic multiplier as: $\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}$ (given in [[Canonical Ensemble]])
