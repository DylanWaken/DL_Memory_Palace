Ising Magnetic Model is the physical design that have all the spins interact with each others to gain lower energy.

Ising model is a statistical mechanic model with lattice particles that are interacting with each others. 

The hamiltonian of the Ising model is given as:
$$E = -J\sum _{i=1} ^Ns_is_{i+1} - H\sum _{i=1}^N s_i$$
- The second term in the right is the same is [[Lattice Gases]], it discribes the interaciton between the spins and the external magnetic field $H$
- The first term describes the interaction between spins.
- $s_i$ is the spin itself, it takes only $+1$ or $-1$
 
The partition function for the 1D Ising model can be found at [[Ising Model Partition Function]]
