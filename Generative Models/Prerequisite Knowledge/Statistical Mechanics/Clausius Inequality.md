The integral here: 
$$\oint \frac{ \delta Q }{T} \le 0 $$
is the path or [[Contour Integral]] of any arbitrary engine cycle. 

Under the ideal case in the [[Carnot Cycle]], there is no energy loss in the cycle with the contour consist of a closed ending. In this case, the path integral, or the change in total entropy of the system will be zero.

In the other word, consider the definition of entropy, the Calusius Inequality states that for any non-ideal carnot heat engine cycle, the total output [[entropy]] of the system:
$$- \oint dS_{Res} =  \oint \frac{ \delta Q }{T} \le 0 $$
mus be greater than or equal to zero.
