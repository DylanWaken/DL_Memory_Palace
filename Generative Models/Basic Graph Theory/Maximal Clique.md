A maximal [[clique]] (***NOT maximum [[clique]]***) is defined as the [[clique]] that can not be expanded by adding any vertices from the [[graph]] $\mathcal{G}$

- There can exist multiple maximal cliques in the [[graph]]
- Maximal [[clique]] is achieved when any of the nodes have the degree of the [[clique]] size. However, this is a sufficient but not necessary condition. (maximal [[clique]] can also be achieved with size less than the degree of any vertices in it)
