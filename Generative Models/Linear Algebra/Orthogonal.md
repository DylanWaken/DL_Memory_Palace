#LinearAlgebra 

if we have 2 vectors in the same [[inner product space]],  2 vectors are said to be orthogonal to each others ($x \perp y$) if and only if:
$$<x, y> = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^Ty = 0$$

- All pairs of orthogonal vectors (except zero vectors) are [[linearly independent]] to each others. but not all [[linearly independent]] vector pairs are orthogonal to each others.
