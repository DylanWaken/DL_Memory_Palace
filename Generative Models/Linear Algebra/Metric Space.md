A metric space is a set with a distance function that defines the distance between all elements of the set. This distance function is called the metric on the set.

A example of metric space is the Euclidean space

Assert $W$ is a not empty set, for any two elements $x$, $y \in W$ , under the given metric $d$ exists a real value $d(x,y)$ corresponds to the two elements such that:

- 1: Positive Qualification: $d(x,y) \geq 0$ , with $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$ 
- 2: Symmetric: $d(x,y)$ = $d(y,x)$ 
- 3. Trigonometric inequality: $d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)$ 

With this conditions satisfied, we say that $d(x,y)$ is the metric (distance) of the set $W$ and $W$ is the metric space of $d$.
