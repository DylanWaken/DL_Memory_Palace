Laplace distribution, or also called double-exponential-distribution, is a symmetrical probabilistic distribution, its probabilistic density function looks like this:

Its CDF is like this:

The PDF of the distribution:
$$f(x; \mu, b) = \frac{1}{2b} \exp(-\frac{x-\mu}{b})$$
- $b$ is the density or scaling factor (control distrib width)
- $\mu$ is the location parameter, controls the center of distribution
