Gaussian distribution, also called the normal distribution, is the normally asserted distrib of random variables in modern statistics. Many data including randomness is distributed in this formfactor. The shape of the distrib looks like this:

The [[Probability Density]] function looks like this:

$$\mathcal{N}(E[X], Var[X]) = \frac{1}{2\pi Var[X]} \exp(-\frac{(x-E[X])^2}{2Var[X]})$$

Which can be also written in terms of average $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ ($\sqrt{Var[X]}$ )

$$\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma^2} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
Changing the [[variance]] would change how flat the curve is, and change mean / [[expectation]] would change the location of the curve.
