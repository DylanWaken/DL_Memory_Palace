## Probability Mass Function

A probability mass function (PMF) is the function over the sample space of a discrete ramdom variable that gives the probability of the variable at a certain value. Assuming there exists a discrete random variable X, the probability mass function of X is defined as:

$$P_X(x) = P(X = x)$$

We define $Val(X)$ as the set of all possible outcomes of the random variable $X$, the PMF of X must satisfy the following properties:

$0 \leq P_x(X) \leq 1$

$\sum _{x\in Va1\left( x\right) }P\left( x\right) =1$

$\sum _{A(x)} P_X(x) = P(X \in A)$
